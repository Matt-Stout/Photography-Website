		<h2>About</h2>
		<img src="images/matt_mls_histsoc.png" alt="Matt leaning at historical society" class="about-img-left" />
		<p class="p-right">My name is Matt Stout, and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am majoring in Computer Sciences with a Certificate in Digital Studies. I like playing soccer, playing video games, and reading in my free time. Football is my favorite sport to watch on TV. My favorite show currently is "The Handmaid's Tale" on HBO. Photography was actually a small hobby before I took CA 155, so this class actually enhanced some of the skills that I had already started to develop. I had a little practice editing photos with Lightroom, but this course introduced me to Photoshop, which was neat to work with.

		<p class="p-left">I currently have an internship as a Software Developer at TDS Telecom on the west side of Madison. It is a great experience to have, with plenty of exposure to some of the programming environments and languages and styles used in the real world. I work with a couple of different kinds of applications, using primarily C# and ASP.NET. I have been working more with some of the company's web applications lately, which has been an inspiration for me to get into web development and design in my spare time. I think that might be a career path that I will pursue after graduation.
